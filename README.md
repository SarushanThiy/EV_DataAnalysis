# Task
Greenwish Ltd needs a new fleet of sales rep cars for the UK. 
Employees, shareholders, clients and customers all want electric vehicles considering the large millage done by reps every year.

1. Which make and model to buy?
2. Which factors/variables are relevant to the decision?
3. Show your conclusions with persuasive visuals

## The main factors which can be viewed to decide which car is best are:
 - Fastcharge Speed
 - Battery Capacity
 - Maximum distance it can travel in different climates

### Which manufacturers make the most electric cars?
The dataset contained 34 different manufacturers. From these 34, only 11 have created over 6 different vehicles each. The biggest manufacturer is Mercedes with 24 vehicles, followed by Porche and Audi with 16 and 14 respectively. This would suggest that Greenwish Ltd board should select a car from one of these manufacturers
